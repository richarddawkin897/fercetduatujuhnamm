                However, later we learned that&#039;s not the case. At long last, tesla has unveiled its model y electric crossover, based on the same platform as the model 3, at the company&#039;s design studio in los angeles. Photo from my model y test ride.

    <h3>We have 3 kids, and we&#039;re specifically moving down to the model y from the x, because it has one.</h3>
    <p>The third row seat is best in its class (i mean suv&#039;s not mini vans). Tesla model y autobahn range at 120 vs 150 kph (english subtitles). The third row seat is best in its class (i mean suv&#039;s not mini vans). We are family of 7 and all the kids are already in middle/high school.</p>
