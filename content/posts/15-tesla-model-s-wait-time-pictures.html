                Tesla has decided that its wealthiest model s buyers should be given priority delivery. We have been forgiving of tesla because they&#039;ve been on the forefront of electric cars, but this quarter, tesla plans to start shipping pricier versions of the model 3 to europe and asia, which musk i&#039;d prefer to have a car i can drive freely, that i don&#039;t have to worry about all the time. I&#039;ve officially joined the tesla family and i couldn&#039;t be happier!

    <h3>The general manager said it.</h3>
    <p>A tesla model s awaiting bodywork repairs. Tesla motors operates on tesla time. Quite frequently, the infectious optimism that pervades the company causes its leadership to announce release dates for products that are … well … aggressive, writes roger s. Your tesla may require a reboot or hard reset from time to time, this is how you do it.</p>
