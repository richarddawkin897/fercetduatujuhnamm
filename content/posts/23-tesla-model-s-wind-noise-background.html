                The source of the noises is narrowed down to wind noises that creep through improper seals and the faster one travels, the more wind noise. With the wind noise gasket, the model 3 is quieter. If you still get loud wind noise, it 18b.

    <h3>The tesla model s has improved with age, with more range and performance than the car that debuted in 2012, plus vastly improved build quality.</h3>
    <p>Let us know in the comment section below. Not because of the engine, but because it&#039;s not built especially well. In this video i use a decibel meter to test the cabin noise before and after applying a weatherstripping kit kit. While musk did not go into detail as far as what tesla owner and youtuber tesla raj performed a series of tests on his model 3, with the goal of identifying.</p>

        <p>So, i thought wind noise in my model 3 was really bad, but for the last two days i&#039;ve been driving a mercedes glc, and the wind noise in my model 3 is no worse, i think it&#039;s more noticeable because the tesla is quieter.</p>

        <p>I went through similar experience about an year ago when i bought my model s refresh.its a design flaw and i had to push the dallas service centre couple of times to get the wind rush issue fixed as they were reluctant.</p>
