    <p><strong>Download Tesla Model S P85 Battery Pics</strong>. Since my battery was replaced at about 1 year into ownership this data should not be contaminated by the algorithm changes that tesla made early on. With the long range of the model s, battery degradation should not meaningfully impact the capabilities of the vehicle even after a rather long period of time.</p>

    <h3>Based around 444 panasonic ncr18650b cells running in 74p6s configuration.</h3>
    <p>Like most automakers, tesla measures the battery capacity of their electric vehicles by the total energy potential of the pack rather than the total usable capacity. Since my battery was replaced at about 1 year into ownership this data should not be contaminated by the algorithm changes that tesla made early on. Performance data for 85 kwh battery vs. He did it through a tear down of the since discontinued 85 kwh battery pack of a model s.</p>
