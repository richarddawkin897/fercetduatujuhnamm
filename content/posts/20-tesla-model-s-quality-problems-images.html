    <p><strong>20+ Tesla Model S Quality Problems Images</strong>. And it&#039;s not surprising to hear of quality problems for any company with as short a track history as tesla&#039;s. To our way of thinking, it&#039;s better to keep the cars back and build them properly rather than charging ahead with deliveries at the cost of quality.</p>

                Tesla&#039;s model s had problems with its air suspension and main computer and touchscreen controls, according to jake fisher, senior director of auto now, fisher said, we see a variety of problems on that car. Reports of serious quality problems have circulated ever since tesla launched the model 3. And now ceo elon musk is admitting even his harshest critic was right.

    <h3>And now ceo elon musk is admitting even his harshest critic was right.</h3>
    <p>To our way of thinking, it&#039;s better to keep the cars back and build them properly rather than charging ahead with deliveries at the cost of quality. Appropriately, tesla touts the model s p100d as the fastest production car in the world. But it has gone more slowly than even tesla&#039;s harshest critics anticipated. Nhtsa expands tesla touchscreen probe to 158,000 vehicles.</p>
